# My-App-Crashed-Now-What?
This is a two-part project about how to fix an iOS buggy program, which demo code I've implemented with a step by step tutorial.
I believe that is a good tutorial to review debugging skill and a few hint we usually forgot.

The first part of the tutorial introduced SIGABRT and EXC_BAD_ACCESS errors, and illustrated some strategies for resolving them using the Xcode debugger and Exception Breakpoints.

The second part of the tutorial, you will add some more tools to your debugging arsenal, including the NSLog() statement, breakpoints and Zombie Objects.

For more detail, you can see the website.
